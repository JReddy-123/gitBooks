            Welcome To The College Student's Auction Page
        </h2>
        <p> 
            GitBooks & MORE is a student focused online marketplace where students and alumni can 
            buy and sell academic materials such as textbooks, calculators, dorm room items, and 
            all other school supplies that are no longer needed by other students.

            Why Did We Start This?
        </h2>
        <p>
            College students often struggle with overpriced campus bookstores and unreliable third party 
            sellers, making it difficult to access affordable course materials. While platforms like eBay 
            and Facebook Marketplace support general buying and selling, they are not tailored to the 
            academic community and often lack reliability.
        </p>

            GitBooks & MORE is designed specifically for the UNC Charlotte community, ensuring authenticity, 
            affordability, and easy access to course related materials directly aligned with professorsâ€™ 
            requirements. This makes it not only a cost saving tool, but also a trusted marketplace that 
            addresses the unique needs of the student body.
